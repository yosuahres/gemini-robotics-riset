Instructions:
- Coordinates must be normalized values between 0-1000
- Focus on the most prominent/complete instance of the {object}
- Ensure tight bounding box around the object
- If {object} is not clearly visible, return: {{"box_2d": null}}

Be precise and accurate with coordinate detection."""

Your role is to detect and locate objects with high accuracy.

Analyze the image and identify the target object's position and characteristics.

- Clear visibility and occlusion
- Object completeness in frame
- Precise coordinate mapping

Provide accurate bounding box coordinates for reliable tracking.

Your task is to verify the accuracy and quality of object detection results.

Analyze the detected object and its bounding box for:

Quality Metrics:
- Bounding box tightness and accuracy
- Object visibility and clarity
- Detection confidence level
- Coordinate precision

Assessment Categories:
- "excellent" - Perfect detection with tight bounding box
- "good" - Accurate detection with minor margin issues  
- "acceptable" - Detected but with loose/imprecise boundaries
- "poor" - Object detected but coordinates are significantly off
- "failed" - Object not detected or completely wrong coordinates

Provide quality assessment to improve tracking performance."""

Analyze the provided image and identify all significant objects a user might interact with.

- "function": A brief description of what the object does (e.g., "for drinking", "toggles power").
- "box_2d": The bounding box coordinates [top, left, bottom, right], normalized from 0-1000.

trajectory_prompt = """You are a robotic trajectory planner with computer vision capabilities. Analyze the provided image carefully to locate the target object and plan a precise trajectory.

TASK: "{task}"

STEP 1 - IMAGE ANALYSIS:
First, carefully examine the image to locate:
- The door handle/lever position (look for brass/golden colored lever handle)
- Its exact location in the image (left side, center, right side)
- Its approximate coordinates as percentages of image width/height
- The handle orientation and operation direction

STEP 2 - TRAJECTORY PLANNING:
Generate a realistic robot trajectory with these phases:
1. START: Begin from a safe approach position
2. APPROACH: Move toward the handle location you identified
3. POSITION: Get close to the handle for optimal grip
4. ACTION: Perform the handle operation (press down for lever handles)
5. RETRACT: Move away after completing the action

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Coordinates MUST be normalized 0.0-1.0 (percentage of image dimensions)
- Generate EXACTLY 4-6 trajectory points
- Points must target the ACTUAL handle location you see in the image
- x: 0.0 (left edge) to 1.0 (right edge)
- y: 0.0 (top edge) to 1.0 (bottom edge)

HANDLE-SPECIFIC RULES:
- For lever handles: approach from the side, contact the lever, press DOWN, then release
- The handle is typically on the LEFT side of doors at mid-height
- Account for handle size (typically 10-15cm long)

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON array only, no explanation):
[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4], [x5, y5]]

EXAMPLE for door handle at position (0.15, 0.55):
[[0.1, 0.5], [0.13, 0.53], [0.15, 0.55], [0.15, 0.6], [0.12, 0.57]]

VERIFICATION:
✓ Located handle in image
✓ 4-6 coordinate pairs
✓ All values 0.0-1.0
✓ Trajectory targets actual handle position
✓ Smooth movement sequence
✓ Valid JSON format only
