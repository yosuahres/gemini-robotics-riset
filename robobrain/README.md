## 🔥 Overview
Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various multimodal contexts. However, their application in robotic scenarios, particularly for long-horizon manipulation tasks, reveals significant limitations. These limitations arise from the current MLLMs lacking three essential robotic brain capabilities: **(1) Planning Capability**, which involves decomposing complex manipulation instructions into manageable sub-tasks; **(2) Affordance Perception**, the ability to recognize and interpret the affordances of interactive objects; and **(3) Trajectory Prediction**, the foresight to anticipate the complete manipulation trajectory necessary for successful execution. To enhance the robotic brain's core capabilities from abstract to concrete, we introduce ShareRobot, a high-quality heterogeneous dataset that labels multi-dimensional information such as task planning, object affordance, and end-effector trajectory. ShareRobot's diversity and accuracy have been meticulously refined by three human annotators. Building on this dataset, we developed RoboBrain, an MLLM-based model that combines robotic and general multi-modal data, utilizes a multi-stage training strategy, and incorporates long videos and high-resolution images to improve its robotic manipulation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance across various robotic tasks, highlighting its potential to advance robotic brain capabilities.

``` 

## <a id="Inference">⭐️ Inference</a>

### 1. Usage for Planning Prediction

#### Option 1: HF inference

```python
from inference import SimpleInference

model_id = "BAAI/RoboBrain"
model = SimpleInference(model_id)

prompt = "Given the obiects in the image, if you are required to complete the task \"Put the apple in the basket\", what is your detailed plan? Write your plan and explain it in detail, using the following format: Step_1: xxx\nStep_2: xxx\n ...\nStep_n: xxx\n"

image = "./assets/demo/planning.png"

pred = model.inference(prompt, image, do_sample=True)
print(f"Prediction: {pred}")

''' 
Prediction: (as an example)
    Step_1: Move to the apple. Move towards the apple on the table.
    Step_2: Pick up the apple. Grab the apple and lift it off the table.
    Step_3: Move towards the basket. Move the apple towards the basket without dropping it.
    Step_4: Put the apple in the basket. Place the apple inside the basket, ensuring it is in a stable position.
'''

```

#### Option 2: VLLM inference
Install and launch VLLM
```bash
# Install vllm package
pip install vllm==0.6.6.post1

# Launch Robobrain with vllm
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model BAAI/RoboBrain --served-model-name robobrain  --max_model_len 16384 --limit_mm_per_prompt image=8
```

Run python script as example:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

openai_api_key = "robobrain-123123" 
openai_api_base = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=openai_api_key,
    base_url=openai_api_base,
)

prompt = "Given the obiects in the image, if you are required to complete the task \"Put the apple in the basket\", what is your detailed plan? Write your plan and explain it in detail, using the following format: Step_1: xxx\nStep_2: xxx\n ...\nStep_n: xxx\n"

image = "./assets/demo/planning.png"

with open(image, "rb") as f:
    encoded_image = base64.b64encode(f.read())
    encoded_image = encoded_image.decode("utf-8")
    base64_img = f"data:image;base64,{encoded_image}"

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="robobrain",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": base64_img}},
                {"type": "text", "text": prompt},
            ],
        },
    ]
)

content = response.choices[0].message.content
print(content)

'''
Prediction: (as an example)
    Step_1: Move to the apple. Move towards the apple on the table.
    Step_2: Pick up the apple. Grab the apple and lift it off the table.
    Step_3: Move towards the basket. Move the apple towards the basket without dropping it.
    Step_4: Put the apple in the basket. Place the apple inside the basket, ensuring it is in a stable position.
'''
```

#### Option 3: FlagScale Serve
[FlagScale](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagScale) is a comprehensive toolkit designed to support the entire lifecycle of large models, developed with the backing of the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI). FlagScale supports distributed deployment of large models, which can be launched easily through a simple configuration file.

**Set config file and install FlagScale**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagScale.git

cd FlagScale

# service config
vim examples/llava_onevision/conf/config_llava_onevision.yaml
# model config
vim examples/llava_onevision/conf/serve/serve_llava.yaml
# (multiple nodes deployment required)
vim examples/llava_onevision/conf/hostfile.txt

# install FlagScale
pip install .
```

For better integration with FlagScale, you can optionally install [vLLM inside FlagScale](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagScale?tab=readme-ov-file#setup).

**Launch service**
```bash
# launch service with default config file
flagscale serve llava_onevision
# or launch service with custom config file
flagscale serve llava_onevision <MODEL_CONFIG_YAML>
```
The Python script used to call the service remains the same as before.


### 2. Usage for Affordance Prediction
```python
from inference import SimpleInference

model_id = "BAAI/RoboBrain"
lora_id = "BAAI/RoboBrain-LoRA-Affordance"
model = SimpleInference(model_id, lora_id)

# Example 1:
prompt = "You are a robot using the joint control. The task is \"pick_up the suitcase\". Please predict a possible affordance area of the end effector?"

image = "./assets/demo/affordance_1.jpg"

pred = model.inference(prompt, image, do_sample=False)
print(f"Prediction: {pred}")

'''
    Prediction: [0.733, 0.158, 0.845, 0.263]
'''

# Example 2:
prompt = "You are a robot using the joint control. The task is \"push the bicycle\". Please predict a possible affordance area of the end effector?"

image = "./assets/demo/affordance_2.jpg"

pred = model.inference(prompt, image, do_sample=False)
print(f"Prediction: {pred}")

'''
    Prediction: [0.600, 0.127, 0.692, 0.227]
'''

```

Your answer should be formatted as a list of tuples, i.e. [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...], where each tuple contains the x and y coordinates of a point."

image = "./assets/demo/trajectory_1.png"

pred = model.inference(prompt, image, do_sample=False)
print(f"Prediction: {pred}")

'''
    Prediction: [[0.375, 0.297], [0.281, 0.344], [0.214, 0.406], [0.172, 0.473]]

# Example 2:
prompt = "You are a robot using the joint control. The task is \"reach for the banana\". Please predict up to 10 key trajectory points to complete the task. Your answer should be formatted as a list of tuples, i.e. [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...], where each tuple contains the x and y coordinates of a point."
